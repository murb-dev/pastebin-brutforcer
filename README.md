## pastebin Bruteforcer

this is a very simple (and very bad) program to bruteforce pastebin urls

the program will alert you if it finds any links  (or crashes) via ntfy.sh

usage:
install the requests module using "pip install requests" 
make a ntfy.sh url and set the "NTFYURL" variable to it
run the program and wait :3
